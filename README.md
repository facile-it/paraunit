Paraunit is a tool for faster executions of PHPUnit test suites. It makes this possible by launching multiple test in parallel with single PHPUnit processes.

Paraunit is developed using Symfony components.

## Installation
To use this package, use Composer:

 * from CLI: `composer require --dev facile-it/paraunit`
 * or, directly in your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "facile-it/paraunit": "^1.3"
    }
}
```

### Compatibility
You can use Paraunit with many versions of PHPUnit or Symfony, following this compatibility list:

| Paraunit version     | Compatible PHPUnit Version | Compatible Symfony Version |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 2.0 (to be released) | 10+                        | 4.4, 5, 6                  |
| 1.3                  | 9.3+                       | 4.4, 5, 6                  |
| 1.2                  | 9.3+                       | 3.4, 4, 5                  |
| 1.1                  | 9.1, 9.2                   | 3.4, 4, 5                  |
| 1.0.*                | 7, 8                       | 3.4, 4, 5                  |
| 0.12.*               | 6, 7                       | 2.8, 3, 4                  |

## Usage
Paraunit starts as a Symfony console command, but it's provided through a bin launcher; you can run it like this:<br/>
(assuming your Composer's bin dir is `vendor/bin`)
```
vendor/bin/paraunit run
```
This command will launch all the tests in all your configured testsuites.

### Collect test coverage
Paraunit is also able to **collect the test coverage in parallel**, like this:
```
vendor/bin/paraunit coverage --html=./dir
```

It **automatically uses the best coverage driver available**: it tries to use [Pcov](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov) if available (since it's the fastest), otherwise it uses [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/). If neither are available, it should always be able to use [PHPDbg](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.phpdbg.php), which is bundled in PHP core, so it should be always present. It can produce coverage in the same formats that PHPUnit provides: HTML, Clover, XML, Crap4j, PHP, text file and text to console.
