While I'm actively working on a big refactor toward [supporting PHPUnit 9](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149), I've found two small fixes that have to be released as the first stable patch since the 1.0 release.

Here's the changelog:

### Fixed
 * Fix handling of PHPUnit `--stderr` option [#144](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/144), thanks @pczerkas
 * Fix small issue in checking coverage data syntax [8f70c](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/commit/8f70c479adf266ccec59103b20895c02ac7ef4c3)
