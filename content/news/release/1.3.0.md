+++

This new minor release comes after more than a year since the last tag.

It actually comes with a couple of new interesting features, one of which is a new behavior for tests parallelization. The new `--chunk-size` option, when set at a value higher that `1`, will execute more than one test class per single process, making the execution faster for test suites where the class setup is expensive. 

Here's the full changelog of the release:
