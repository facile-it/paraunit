This releases has nothing big on the outside, but a lot of code rework under the hood. The DI has been completely migrated from YAML to PHP (so no more `symfony/yaml`) and support for Symfony 4 has been added; also, a small bug has been fixed.

Here's the full changelog:
### Added
 * Added support for Symfony 4

### Changed
 * Migrated the whole DI configuration from YAML to PHP 
 * Require at least jean85/pretty-package-versions 1.0.3 (see related [#3](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/issues/3))

### Fixed
 * When a test class is retried, previous tests are no longer shown/counted toward executed tests (#109). 

### Removed
 * Removed support for Symfony 2.7
 * Removed dependency from `symfony/yaml`
