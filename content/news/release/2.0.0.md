+++

This new major version has seen its inception a long time ago, on [October 2021](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/162), and it went to sleep for a long time, since PHPUnit development was doing the same. After [some additional attempts](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/172), I was finally able to complete this alongside the long-awaited release of PHPUnit 10.

All the changes in PHPUnit allowed me to finally bump the minimum PHP version to 8.1 (so that `enum`s are now usable!) and do a big refactoring of internals, changing and simplifying the way tests outcome are handled. Also, I took the occasion to clean up all the additional options that were hard-coded, and add the `--pass-through` option as a viable alternative. 

The full changelog is small, the changes for the end user are small, but the code changes are a lot!

### Added
* Support for PHPUnit 10
* `--pass-through` option [#194](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/194)
### Changed
* The integration mechanic with PHPUnit has now changed, and it now leverages the new [event system](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4676); to do that, Paraunit will need a bootstrap extension registered in the PHPUnit XML config; at the first run without it, Paraunit will ask if you want to add it automatically [#186](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/186)
### Removed
* Drop support for PHPUnit < 10
