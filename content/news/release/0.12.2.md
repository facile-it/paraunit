Today I released a new small patch for Paraunit, fixing an output bug and intercepting a new king of retryable exception.

Here's the full changelog:

### Fixed
 * Allow multiple, comma-separated values with the `--testsuite` option, like with PHPUnit 6+ [#122](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/122)
 * Avoid letting the colored console output blink (dots, errors) [#124](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/124) thanks to @elegos 
 * Add a new exception about MySQL savepoint to the retryable ones [#125](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/125)
