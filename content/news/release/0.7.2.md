[Paraunit 0.7.2](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.7.2) has just been released with a minor fix: colored output has been disabled from text coverage output to console, since it may cause incompatibilities. I will think of a way to re-enable it if possible in later releases.


Full changelog text:

### Fixed

* Disable colored output in text coverage to console, to avoid issues with GitLab integration.
