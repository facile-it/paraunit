[Paraunit 0.9.2](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.9.2) and [Paraunit 0.8.3](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.8.3) has been released to fix a nasty little bug that I got reported to me: two dependencies were missing and the CI missed that due to the fact that both were required by dev dependencies.

I fixed that and backported the fix to the 0.8 series, since it was very easy to do.

Here's the full changelog:

### Fixed
* Add missing dependencies: `symfony/yaml` and `symfony/stopwatch`
