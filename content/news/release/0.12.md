+++

Wiht this release, I had to do some under-the-hood changes, but we finally support PHPUnit 7; to do that I had to bump the minimum PHP required version to 7.1. I've also added a better support for text coverage report, adding the possibility of obtaining just the summary report. 

Here's the full changelog:

### Added
 * Added support for PHPUnit 7 and `phpunit/php-code-coverage` 6

### Changed
 * The coverage text output options have changed:
   * The `--text` option now accepts a filename as an argument, and defaults to the console as output (replacing `--text-to-console`) 
   * The new `--text-summary` option behaves in the same way, but it writes only the summary part 

### Removed
 * Removed support for PHP 7.0 (needed to support PHPUnit 7 correctly)
 * Dropped the `--text-to-console` coverage option in favor of the new behavior
