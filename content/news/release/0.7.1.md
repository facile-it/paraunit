+++

[Paraunit 0.7.1](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.7.1) has just been released; this is just a minor release that adds a new useful feature: the **text format** for the coverage. You can either use it on screen as an integration tool (see Jenkins, GitLab), or save it as a file. Since there is a small limitation in CLI options handling by the Symfony component, this feature is implemented through two separate options.

In the next versions, I will work to implement the other missing formats, PHP and Crap4j.

The official changelog is this below:

### Changed

* Added support to the text coverage format with two new CLI options: `--text-to-console` to output it directly onto the standard output, and `--text=filename.txt` to save it into a file; this is highly useful with various CI/CD integrations like Jenkins and GitLab.
