+++

With this release, Paraunit replaces the suggestion of `facile-it/paraunit-testcase` with `dama/doctrine-test-bundle`; also there's a new feature that will report any test failure due to deprecation warnings catched by the Symfony PHPUnit Bridge. 

Here's the full changelog:

### Added
 * Add support for deprecation warnings found by `symfony/phpunit-bridge`: failures and tests output are now reported

### Changed
 * Start suggesting `dama/doctrine-test-bundle` instead of `facile-it/paraunit-testcase`, since it has been abandoned.
