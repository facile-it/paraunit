Paraunit 0.6 has been released! In the meantime, the coverage feature is being developed on its branch, I hope to have
it working soon and release it in 0.7.

Here's what's changed in 0.6:

### Changed

* MASSIVE refactoring of the result output parsing (#31, #33) and the result printing (#37): now Paraunit fetches the 
  tests' results using PHPUnit's `--log-json` option (thanks to @taueres for the idea).
  This grants a lot of new features:
  * Parsing of tests results is more robust, it should never fail!
  * Fatal errors or segfaults are now grouped as "Abnormal termination"
  * When a test has an abnormal termination, the culpable test function is indicated
  * Tests with abnormal termination are printed out in full output
  * Tests executed in a test class that has a later abnormal termination are showed and counted in results anyhow
* Added support for warnings, introduced in PHPUnit 5.1 (#30)
* Added support for risky outcomes

### Fixed

* Removed `Container.php` file and `CompilerPass` class in favor of proper usage of Symfony's components
* `paraunit` bin now uses the container directly
* FinalPrinter class splitted in 3 classes
