+++

I returned to develop some more on Paraunit in the last months, initially to add a few new compatibilities (PHP 7.4, Symfony 5), but then I spent some time to add support for Pcov as a coverage driver. This new addition is pretty interesting, since it speeds up test execution with coverage collection a lot, making it nearly as fast as without coverage. Try it out!

This is the full changelog for this second beta release:

### Added
 * Add support for PHP 7.4
 * Add support for Symfony 5
 * Add support for ext-pcov as a coverage driver [#146](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/146)

### Changed
 * Update PHPStan to 0.12 [#145](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/145)
 * Prefer Pcov or Xdebug over PHPDBG as coverage driver [#146](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/146)
