Today I released a new small patch for Paraunit, fixing the support for a hidden dependency (`phpunit/php-file-iterator`) which broke Paraunit with its 2.0 release.

Here's the full changelog:

### Fixed
 * Allow explicitly phpunit/php-file-iterator 2 [#126](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/126)
